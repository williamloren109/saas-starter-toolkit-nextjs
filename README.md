# ‚≠ê Enterprise SaaS Starter Kit

The Open Source Next.js SaaS boilerplate for Enterprise SaaS app development.

Please star ‚≠ê the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving the SaaS Starter Kit! üòÄ

## üìñ Additional Resources
Next.js-based SaaS starter kit saves you months of development by starting you off with all the features that are the same in every product, so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  This is a React framework that provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It's used for building the user interface of your application. The main configuration for Next.js can be found in next.config.js.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  This is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's used for styling the application. The configuration for Tailwind CSS can be found in postcss.config.js.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
  This is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It's used for storing application data. The connection to Postgres is likely managed through Prisma.
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used for creating the interactive elements of your application. The React components are located in the components directory.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
  This is an open-source database toolkit. It's used for object-relational mapping, which simplifies the process of writing database queries. Prisma configuration and schema can be found in the prisma directory.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  This is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It's used to make the code more robust and maintainable. TypeScript definitions and configurations can be found in files like next-env.d.ts and i18next.d.ts.
- [Svix](https://www.svix.com/) (Provides Webhook Orchestration)
  This is a service for handling webhooks. It's used to emit events on user/team CRUD operations, which can then be caught and handled by other parts of the application or external services. The integration of Svix is distributed throughout the codebase, primarily in areas where Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations are executed.
- [Retraced](https://github.com/retracedhq/retraced) (Provides Audit Logs Service)
  This is a service for audit logging and data visibility. It helps track user activities within the application i.e (who did what and when in the application). The usage of Retraced would be dispersed throughout the codebase, likely in the files where important actions are performed.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) (Provides Payments)
  This is a service for handling payments. It's used to process payments for the application. The integration of Stripe is likely found in the files associated with billing and subscriptions.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (Provides E2E tests)
  This is a Node.js library for automating browsers. It's used to run end-to-end tests on the application. The Playwright configuration and tests can be found in the tests directory.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Provides Docker Compose)
  This is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It's used to containerize the application and its dependencies. The Docker configuration can be found in the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) (Provides Authentication)
  This is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It's used to handle user authentication and authorization. The NextAuth.js configuration and providers can be found in the pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts file.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

Please follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)
- PostgreSQL
- NPM
- Docker compose

### Development

#### 1. Setup

- Fork the repository
- Clone the repository by using this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/saas-starter-toolkit-next.git
```

#### 2. Go to the project folder

```bash
cd saas-starter-toolkit-next
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Set up your .env file

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 5. Create a database (Optional)

To make the process of installing dependencies easier, we offer a `docker-compose.yml` with a Postgres container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 6. Set up database schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

#### 7. Start the server

In a development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 8. Start the Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

#### 9. Testing

We are using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to execute E2E tests. Add all tests inside the `/tests` folder.

Update `playwright.config.ts` to change the playwright configuration.

##### Install Playwright dependencies

```bash
npm run playwright:update
```

##### Run E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

_Note: HTML test report is generated inside the `report` folder. Currently supported browsers for test execution `chromium` and `firefox`_
